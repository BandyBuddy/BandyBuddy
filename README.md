**Revolutionizing how venues deliver entertainment and how creators engage with music.**

## üëã Welcome to the BandyBuddy Project!

BandyBuddy is an ambitious project aiming to transform live venue entertainment and empower a new generation of music creators. We're building an AI-powered platform that tackles the prohibitive costs and logistical headaches venues face, while also providing a unique space for users to craft, perform, and distribute original music.

**We are actively seeking passionate and skilled individuals, especially potential Co-Founders and early-stage Developers, to join us on this exciting journey!** If you're excited by AI, music, interactive experiences, and building something truly innovative from the ground up, read on!

## üöÄ What is BandyBuddy?

BandyBuddy is a dual-faceted platform:

1.  **For Live Venues (B2B):**
    *   An AI-powered system that automates engaging, interactive events like karaoke, quizzes, stand-up comedy, and bingo.
    *   Features dynamic AI hosts (like our flagship character, "Bandy") and interactive elements to significantly reduce venue overhead and operational burdens.
    *   Aims to increase footfall, dwell time, and revenue for pubs, bars, hotels, and other entertainment spaces.
    *   Simple integration requiring standard AV equipment.

2.  **For Online Creators & Users (B2C/C2C):**
    *   A unique online platform and mobile app where users can:
        *   Craft original songs using intuitive, AI-assisted tools (lyrics, melodies, chords, backing tracks).
        *   Own their original music.
        *   Perform their creations in an "Online Showcase" and compete.
        *   Distribute their original music to major platforms (e.g., Spotify, TikTok) via BandyBuddy, sharing in the revenue.
    *   Fosters a vibrant user-generated content ecosystem, bypassing complex traditional licensing for original user content.

**Our Vision:** To become a highly scalable, defensible leader in tech-powered social entertainment, creating a powerful flywheel between venues and users.

## üõ†Ô∏è The Tech Stack & Architecture

BandyBuddy is a complex system being built with modern technologies. The project is currently structured across several distinct repositories to manage different components effectively. While specific technologies within each service may evolve, our current stack includes (but is not limited to):

*   **Frontend (User & Venue Interfaces):**
    *   Web: React, Next.js, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3/TailwindCSS
    *   Mobile (Planned): React Native or native development (Swift/Kotlin)
*   **Backend & Core Logic:**
    *   Primary: Python (FastAPI, Django)
    *   Microservices architecture
    *   Real-time communication: WebSockets, WebRTC
*   **AI & Machine Learning:**
    *   Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn)
    *   LLMs (e.g., for AI host scripting, lyric/music generation assistance - exploring various APIs and open-source models like Llama, Mistral)
    *   Voice/Audio Processing: Librosa, SpeechRecognition, TTS/STT engines
    *   Video Generation/Manipulation: (Exploring tools like Stable Diffusion for video, RunwayML, D-ID, HeyGen API for avatars)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL, Redis (for caching/queues)
*   **DevOps & Infrastructure:**
    *   Docker, Kubernetes (for future scaling)
    *   Cloud Platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure - TBD, currently lean local/VPS dev)
    *   CI/CD pipelines

**Current Repository Structure (Conceptual):**

*   `bandybuddy-main-api`: Core backend services, user management, venue logic.
*   `bandybuddy-venue-interface`: Frontend for venue dashboards and event management.
*   `bandybuddy-mobile-app`: (Placeholder for) Mobile application for end-users.
*   `bandybuddy-ai-engine`: Services related to AI hosting, music generation, content analysis.
*   `bandybuddy-creator-studio`: Components for the online music creation tools.
*   `bandybuddy-docs-internal`: (Private repo for sensitive design docs, financials, etc. - *This README is for the public-facing overview*).
